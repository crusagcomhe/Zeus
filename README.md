Zeus – Autonomous Web3 Deployment Agent

Zeus is a groundbreaking local-first AI DevOps engine that translates natural language into secure, production-ready blockchain deployments. It integrates natively with Solana, is designed for modular extension to EVM and Cosmos, and includes security-first planning with zero-knowledge auditing. This repository is designed to meet the highest standards of open-source software—clear folder structure, complete dependency management, and clean documentation.

Allocate 8GB RAM in settings

LLM failure

Check OpenAI token, retry in 1 min

Wallet error

Use Solana devnet or alternate RPC

❓ FAQ

Q: Is this another ChatGPT wrapper?A: No. Zeus includes planning, wallet security, infra generation, and zk-verifiable output—all locally run.

Q: Can I skip Solana and just use it for EVM?A: Yes. All adapters are modular.

Q: Can I trust wallet analysis?A: Yes, it uses off-chain RPC risk detection + heuristics.
